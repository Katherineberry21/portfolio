    <h3> SI 350: User Experience Field Research in the Public Sector</h3>
    <p id = 'projects1' > I was able to take a class the summer after my freshman year through the School 
        of Information called SI 350: User Experience Research. This class was my first 
        chance to learn what user experience is all about. I worked with a team of School
         of Information students with the Ann Arbor city government to solve a problem 
         they were facing. Our problem was simple yet complex: find a way to integrate 
         voice activated technology to make water billing and water billing updates fun 
         and engaging, while keeping it secure. We conducted interviews with government 
         employees, Ann Arbor residents, sent out surveys, built personas, and eventually 
         created a deliverable to present to the Ann Arbor Government. We suggested rolling 
         out voice activated technology slowly, by starting with water usage. Residents could 
         ask how much water they had used so far this month, and how to cut down on water 
         usage. The goal was that if this information is accurately reported to residents it 
         will build trust, and hopefully lead to being able to make payments via voice 
         activated technology. </p>

    <h3>University of Michigan Women's Baskteball Data Analytics</h3>
    <p id = 'projects2'> Since September of 2019, I have been working with the University of Michigan’s 
        Athletics Department as a Data Analyst for the women’s basketball team. I have 
        conducted various different types of research using both a Catapult device and 
        heart rate monitor worn by all players. Catapult devices collect player load, 
        which is an instantaneous measurement that tracks a player’s overall activity 
        and movement. I then used this data to see if player performance could be 
        predicted via heart rate or player load by calculating each player’s player 
        efficiency rating (PER) for each game of the past season and compared those 
        numbers. This March, I will be presenting my work at Michigan’s sports analytics 
        symposium on Monday, March 23rd. </p>
