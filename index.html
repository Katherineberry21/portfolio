                <p> My name is Katherine Berry and I am a junior at the University of Michigan in the School of Information. 
                I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Analysis with a concentration in Sales and marketing 
                through the Ross School of Business. I love Michigan! It has given me the opportunity to find what I am 
                passionate about both inside and outside the classroom. It constantly allows me to challenge myself 
                intellectually and consider things I never thought possible. Some of my most challenging and thought provoking 
                classes at the university have included Calculus 1, SI 106 (my first ever coding class), and now SI 330 “Data 
                Manipulation.” Go blue!  </p>

            </div>
            <p id = 'about2' >I had the opportunity to work at a company called the Magni Group, Inc. Magni is a company that makes anti-
                corrosive paint to prevent metal parts in cars from corroding. I worked there for two summers as an intern in 
                the IT department. I had the chance to complete a lot of cool work, including physically wiring the new wifi 
                routers through the ceiling and shadowing the CIO for a day. I was also able to do research on a new cloud 
                computing system, conduct interviews among employees about their needs, and then create and present mock-ups of 
                what the site could do. </p>

            </div>
            <p id = 'about3'>I currently work at a financial consulting company called Revive+ Consulting. I have had the chance to learn about 
                an industry I never thought I would work in. I have been able to talk to C level executives in the financial 
                consulting industry about their experience, passions, and what has made them so successful. I also have gotten to 
                use my design skills to rebrand a lot of Revive+ and their company resources. Find out more about my ongoing 
                projects here.</p>

            <p id = 'about4'>I am very excited to say that this summer I will be working in Fort Myers, Florida with Gartner! I will be working 
                in their sales department as an intern. I am especially excited for this job because I think it will let me use 
                many of the wide range of skills that I have to offer. Gartner is a global research and advisory firm that sells 
                unbiased research, advice, and information to other businesses. Therefore, both my degree in Information Analysis 
                and my concentration in sales and marketing will likely help me excel in this kind of job. </p>
